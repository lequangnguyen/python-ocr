Latinos in the Garage 9
another rock en espafiol band’s music provided the soundtrack for Coors Light
beer commercials during Monday Night Football broadcasts, and still others as
background music for Levi's jeans commercials aired during the Super Bowl and
otherwise regularly on television. In 2001, The Tonight Show host Jay Leno hosted
Los Aterciopelados,’ a rock band from Colombia that became wildly popular
throughout the world in the 1990s and continues to produce some of the most,
highly regarded rock en espafiol and Latin alternative music in the 2000s. By the
early to mid 2000s, Colombian pop-rock star Shakira could be seen in as many
Pepsi commercials as MTV music videos, and was being touted by the music
industry as ‘the next Madonna’ Most recently, the Colombian pop-rock star Juanes
was a featured artist at the 2009 NBA All-Star game. Asa result of these and other
cultural shifts such as 2000 US Census data revealing the emergence of Latinos/
Hispanics as the largest minority group in the US, contemporary Latino/as are
‘opening up new areas increasingly worthy of scholarly investigation.

Worth noting is the fact that although the latest US Census revealed that
Latino/as are now the largest minority group, the news came on the heels of a
decade of controversy for Latino/as. From legacies of racism and ethnocentrism
to controversial proposals in the 1990s like California's Proposition 187 (which
sought to eliminate social services for undocumented immigrants based on their
undocumented status)’ from complicated social issues like affirmative action to
heated ‘English-only’ debates, from increasing immigration from Latin America
to rampant xenophobia and antiforeigner sentiment after September 11, 2001,
and most recently, from increased visibility in popular culture to the increase in
hate crimes against Latino/as, the rising tide of the Latino/a demographic in the
US must be further contextualized through discussing complex social issues. In
other words, a correlate can be proposed here that while scholars recognize that
Latino/as are now more visible than ever in mainstream American culture, the
supposed emergence of Latino/as in popular music isan issue that provides insight
into contemporary issues in politics and relevant societal questions and, as I argue
here, provides further insight into questions of cultural identity.

‘All of this establishes the rationale for this research and the questions that
follow: What else can be gleaned from the notable presence of Latino/as in US
popular culture? Can Latino/as in popular music aid better understanding of
Latino/as, Latino/a identity, or, pethaps, the complications of Latino/a identity
discourse(s)? In short, one of the aims of this chapter is to reiterate the fact that
popular music should not be dismissed as just popular music but is, in fact, an
important cultural site of discourse, debate, and conflict. Thus, a premise of
this chapter is that some of the tensions and complications of Latino/a identity
are articulated in media and popular culture. At the same time, some further
