How many times have you found an old company PDF (or
image) and needed to gain quick access to the text within,
only to find you cannot locate the editable version of the file
or copying and pasting is failing you? Or maybe you only
need to quickly convert a PDFs or images into a Word (or
LibreOffice) document, so it can be used for another purpose.
Sure you can purchase software that will allow you to do just
that, but if you’re a Google Drive user, you already have that
ability at your fingertips. That's right, Google Docs does a
pretty impressive job of converting PDF documents to regular
Google Docs. It’s not perfect—it's more an OCR for PDFs
and images—but if you're looking for a means to get to that
precious text, this is a handy way to do just that.
